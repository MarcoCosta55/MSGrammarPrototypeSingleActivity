### PC Installation
***
The following instructions are for installing the BlueStacks 4 Android emulator for Windows 10. BlueStacks is also available on Mac. I have not tested this program extensively, nor do I endorse its use. This is just the easiest way I've found to run my app without an Android device.

1. Download the BlueStacks installer from [**BlueStacks.com**](https://www.bluestacks.com/)
2. Run the BlueStacks Installer exe file you just downloaded.
3. If prompted, click "Yes" to let BlueStacks make changes on your device.
4. Click "Install Now".
5. While BlueStacks is installing, [**click here**](https://github.com/MarcoCosta55/MSGrammarPrototypeSingleActivity/raw/master/app-debug.apk) to download the MontessoriSpanish grammar app apk file.
6. When BlueStacks is done installing, it will ask you to sign into Google Play. Click "I'll do it later".
7. Hover over the three dot kebab menu on the home screen. It's in the top left section of the page right next to "Installed apps".
8. Click on "Install apk".
9. Navigate to MontessoriSpanish grammar app apk that you downloaded in step 5, and select "open".
10. Once the app is installed, click the hamburger menu in the top right menu bar and select "Settings".
11. In the "Display" setting, change the orientation from "landscape" to "portrait".
12. Select okay to restart BlueStacks.
13. The MontessoriSpanish Sentence Prototype App should now be ready to use. Enjoy!
